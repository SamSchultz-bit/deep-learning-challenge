# deep-learning-challenge
 
For this challenge I was tasked with analyzing a CSV of data from Alphabet Soup, with information about organizations that it has previously funded to build a tool to help select applicants for future funding.

I created a tool that uses features in the dataset to create a binary classifierto predict if an applicant will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
